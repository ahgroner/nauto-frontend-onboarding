>### Welcome to Front End Development.

##### ðŸ’šðŸš¦ðŸš• Nautoâ€™s awesome, youâ€™re awesome, letâ€™s get to work. ðŸ’»ðŸ“±ðŸ¤˜

#### Load up these tools, in order:
This is assuming you have a recent model MacBook Pro.

#### Apple Xcode:
Apple Developer App
Get it from the Apple App Store.  Youâ€™ll need to get an AppleID for that.
We donâ€™t use this as such, but it provides us with the official xcode command line tools, which are required for everything else.

#### Brew:
MacOS Package Manager
https://brew.sh/
We use this to install several packages.
Installs with a terminal command:
```shell
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### Git:
Super popular version control
Use Brew to install Git:
```shell
brew install git
```

*Slack @leipan to get access to the nauto organization repo on github.*

#### Node:
- **With NVM:**
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
```
**Or:**
```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash\
```

If you donâ€™t have wget then:

```shell
brew install wget
```

Either of the following command will add 

```shell
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

To your `.bashrc` file, or `.zshrc` if you are on zsh.

You need to
```shell
source .bashrc
```
or
```shell
source .zshrc
```

**Check:**
```shell
nvm --version
```

**Install node**
```shell
nvm install 10.9.0
```
```shell
nvm alias default 10.9.0
```

- **With brew:**
The Node.js development system.
https://nodejs.org
Use Brew to install Node:

```shell
brew install node
```

Note: We should be using v10.9.0, although we need older versions for some apps. 

#### Yarn:
Package manager
https://yarnpkg.com
Use Brew to install Yarn:
```shell
brew install yarn
```

#### Microsoft Visual Studio:
Nice software development environment. 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com
Itâ€™s free to download.

(end of Donâ€™s section, the rest needs some work)

#### Github SSH key:
- Head to your github account and click on little triangle next to profile icon
- Choose settings from the dropdown
- On the left tabs select **SSH and GPG keys**
- Click on **New SSH key** button and give your SSH a name:
- Open your terminal and paste the following commands:
`cd`
`shell ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@nauto.com"`
Click enter all the way or rename your SSH key and add phrase if you wanted
`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy` or replacer id_rsa.pub with your public key name
Head back to the browser and paste your key and click add.
- To clone repos to your local use SSH mode
- You will get asked to use your key, type **yes** full word.
- In case if you did not get asked then add your key manually.
`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `git clone repo` again.

More tools to load up
(under construction)

#### Phrase:
https://phrase.com/cli/

#### NPM:
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
Additional Steps

Get invited to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/nauto/packages. Please create an npm account if you donâ€™t already have one.

- Create a Personal Access Token in npm (youâ€™ll need this because w 2FA you canâ€™t use your password)
- Login to npm CLI

#### AWS CLI
https://aws.amazon.com/cli
Additional Steps 
Create a Pull request in the infrastructure. The pull request would look similar to this: https://github.com/nauto/infrastructure/pull/457 - you need to make changes for every environment that you need access to. Hereâ€™s detailed info.

You will also need to decrypt the keys that youâ€™ll get after having your PR approved. Hereâ€™s how to do it. Youâ€™ll need access to Nautoâ€™s 1password Engineering vault - if you donâ€™t see it, you can ask for access in Slacks #it-help.

### Web apps we use:

#### Jira:
You should have received an invite to Jira with your nauto email. If not, email it@nauto.com
Tickets in our component Fleet App (Web)


#### Figma:
Figma is our primary design tool
Create an account using google auth using your Nauto email.
